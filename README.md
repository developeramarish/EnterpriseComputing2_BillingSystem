# EC2_FinalProject

## Objective:
Students are to develop e-commerce financial system based ASP.NET system, using C# programming language, T-SQL, .NET tools and technologies (MS Visual Studio 2015/17 and MS SQL Server 2014), which provide telephone bill payments for the LIME company by customers using Internet.

## Method of development:
This is a group project. Each group must designate a group leader, who is responsible for supervising the development of the project and the coordination between all parts of the project developed by other members of the group.

## Scenario:
Suppose you are a customer of LIME Company and you have saving/checking account in the Scotia Bank. LIME has an account in the National Commercial Bank. Customer must pay a bill for the telephone service, produced by LIME for the period of one month. The Application, which you have to be developed, must provide this bill payment from any workstation connected to the Internet.

## Requirements:
1. Bill has following information about customer and payment:
  * Due date of payment - - Customer ID and Name
  * Statement Date - - Total Amount Due (Jamaican dollars)
  
2. Scotia Bank (customer’s bank) has information about:
  * Customer ID - - Account’s (checking & saving) balance
  * Customer name - - Date & Time of the banking transaction
  * Customer Address - - Type of banking transaction
  
3. National Commercial Bank (NCB – LIME’s bank) has information about:
  * Customer ID (LIME) - - Saving account’s balance
  * Customer name (LIME) - - Date & Time of the banking transaction
  * Customer Address (LIME) - - Type of banking transaction
  
4. Each group must submit the project to the Enterprise Computing lecturer (not to Students’ affairs unit or to the secretaries!) on a CD-ROM (write IDs and names of the students on the CD-ROM) by the due date as stated above. If the project is submitted to lecturer after the due day (April 10, 2018) the evaluation interview will still be conducted, but a penalty is attracted for every late day. Each
day after the due day (including Saturdays and Sundays) will attract a 3% accumulative penalty, which will be deducted from the total mark of project. 

5. Each CD-ROM must have an instruction manual (read.me file, all usernames and passwords for Login procedure) on how to launch the application.

6. Presentation to the tutor of the final project will be based on “face to face” discussion individually with each member of group.

7. Timetable of presentation will be approved at least one week before presentation. If you miss your presentation time (that includes being late, not at a time assigned for your group or did not come at all), you need to write a report to the Head of School of Computing & Information Technology (SCIT) explaining your reasons – the next available interview time will be assigned through Head of SCIT and Programme Director, not by the lecturer.

8. If a student provides a solution and is not able to explain programming code – 80 marks will be taken from project’s item marks.

9. It is possible (and is recommended) that each developer should be responsible for some section of the project. However, developers must be familiar with other parts of project in great detail. It is not acceptable for a student to know only their part of project but has no knowledge about other parts or how their part integrates with the application
